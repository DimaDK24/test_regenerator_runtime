Now it seems to be painful to configure babel 7 to work with jest and async/await syntax.

Here I just want to practice and solve this task.

Repository is named this way, cause many people got `regeneratorRuntime is not defined` error.

To check it on your own:

1. `git clone https://github.com/DimaDK24/test_regenerator_runtime.git`
2. `cd test_regenerator_runtime`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm test`
